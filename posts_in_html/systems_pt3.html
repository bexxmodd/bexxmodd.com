<h1>Inro to Systems Programming with Rust (Part 5)</h1>

<h2>Stream Directions and Job Control</h2>

<br>

<p>
    in previous parts we built a mini UNIX shell which was able to handle handful amount of System Signals and execute user supplied commands.
    We'll expand functionality of our shell and add additional features like ability to accept multiple options with the command and redirect input and output streams. In this part 3 we'll learn:

    <br>

    <ul>- How to redirect stdin and stdout streams</ul>
    <ul>- How to implement stream redirections with Rust</ul>
    <ul>- What is a processes order and job control</ul>
    <ul>- How Rust's <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> makes our code safer</ul>
</p>

<br>

<p>
    If you want to see the the previous version of our mini-shell, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/bexxmodd/systems-with-rust/blob/master/src/main.rs">here</a>. Because in this part we will redo some parts of the program before adding additional functionality to it.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    We will only make signal handler to handle <code>SIGING</code> and <code>SIGQUIT</code> and remove <code>alarm</code> execution completelly as it will be an overhead to this version of shell which will server as an example of how redirection works in UNIX systems.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    We'll add a new struct <code>Tokenizer</code> which will take a line of String and break it into a tokens, which will server as commands, options, and directives. Tokenizer will split a string on whitespace and by calling method <code>next()</code> it will remove each part from the string and return to us.
    Tokenizer will also be able to call <code>peek()</code> which will show what is the next token (if there's any).
