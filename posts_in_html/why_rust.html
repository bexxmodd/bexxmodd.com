<h1> Why You Should Start Using Rust for Side Projects</h1>

If you are a Software Engineer or a Software Developer (which ever title your company uses) and don't 

<p>
    Person side-projects can three important values. First, it's the best way to learn about new technologies, tools, frameworks. Only way you can retain some knowledge from recently learned material is to do some project. . It allows you to experiment, test out ideas, and practice the implementation of those ideas. I personally came to a firm conclusion that I can't say that I understand technology if I haven't done personal implementation of it.

    Second, it's a form of signaling. If you were an economist probably you don't need further clarification. However, I assume majority of readers are not so I'll give a quick tour in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_theory">contract theory.</a>

<p>
    Signaling is the way how one party (namely <i>agent</i>) dispatches the information about itself to another acting party (namely <i>principal</i>). In the job market this can be seen as an attempt by the potential candidate to showcase their ability to the potential employer. For example, your bachelor's degree (if you have one) is a form of signaling. It shows that for at least four years you worked hard, managed to pass the required class, and hopefully attained knowledge.

<p>
    Side projects or portfolio projects are also form of signaling. They convey massage to the potential hiring managers that you can show initiative. You can take ownership of the project and work on it independently. It also demonstrates that you have a genuine interest in a field and desire to learn. Often students and people looking for their first developer roles are highly encouraged to work on personal projects.

    Third, it's a great way to network and make interesting connections. I personally connected with several developers who have contributed to my projects or I contributed to theirs. And this are meaningful connections, because it's voluntarily. You choose with whom you want to work on a project or task, you can find people with the same interest within interest.

<h2>JetBrains Survey</h2>

<p>
Recently JetBrains published <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/rust/">the developer survey for 2020 about Rust programming language </a>. It asked why developers chose to use Rust, how they used Rust, what kind of projects they worked with Rust, if they interact with other languages and other people. It's worth notice that big majority (67%) uses Rust for personal projects/hobbies and 80% of them have been using for less than six months.

</p>
<br>
<p>
I was personally happy to see these numbers. Foremost because this is a organic programming language growth path. People start trying new things, building pet projects, get hooked and then try to convince their employers to use those technologies, or even go and build their companies using those technologies.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Fact that majority of developers have not been with Rust more than six month also indicates that language is in a early stage and still needs to mature. Getting started with Rust now, will give you a frontline seat for the senior roles when Big names will start looking for experience Rust developers. And believe be, the way language is progressing and gaining popularity that time is not that far away.
