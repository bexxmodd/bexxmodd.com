            I'm a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania: School of Engineering and Applied Science. Also, I'm a Data Scientist, and an open-source developer. I write about various topics but mainly about Rust, Python, and C - Different perspectives and use cases of these languages.

            With Python I created, and currently maintain, an open-source Linux terminal program <b><a href="https://github.com/bexxmodd/vizex">vizex</a></b>. The program visually displays disk usage and directory data within a terminal. It's like a combination of popular Linux commands <code>du</code>, <code>df</code>, <code>ls</code> but on steroids.

            I've built predictive models to detect fraud with SQL and Python's Scikit-learn library. I've developed a data pipeline, where I connected to Teradata server using SQL and used Python for the transformation phase. Currently I'm mastering Rust and playing with low-level stuff.
