        Beka Modebadze is a Software Engineer at Agilent Technologies, where he delivers software solutions to company-wide problems. As a Technology of choice he utilizes C# and .NET environment and occasionally Python. He's also a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania: School of Engineering and Applied Science.

 <br/>
 Beka has contributed to open-source projects and maintains one - Linux terminal program <b><a href="https://github.com/bexxmodd/vizex">vizex</a></b>. The program visually displays disk usage and directory data within a terminal. It's like a combination of popular Linux commands du, df, ls but on steroids. Previously he worked as a Data Scientist.

 ...And me? I just love talking to computers. I think they are good listeners. They not always preferred respondents but they always have something interesting to say, even if it's a two-word sentence like <i>"segmentation fault"</i>. I love talking to them in various languages and using different mediums for communication.

 <br/>
 <br/>

 I know computers only understand binary, and I also understand binary but have you (if you are a human I assume) tried talking to SOMEONE in binary? That's why I prefer to use something that has more English words in it, like Rust, C++, C#, and Python. I also love talking with them about low-level stuff, asking how their systems are doing, and helping to hack something.

 <br/>
 <br/>
Then I come to this blog and I write about various topics I discussed with computers. Sometimes I even get Philosophical and try to see computers from that perspective.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 I love everything Sci-fi and consider myself a Lego enthusiast. My interests and career goals are aligned with Software Engineering. I'm passionate about better understanding computers and using this knowledge to solve real-world problems.
