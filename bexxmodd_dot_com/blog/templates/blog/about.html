            I'm a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania: School of Engineering and Applied Science, 
            Also, I'm Data Scientist, and an open-source developer.

            <br>
            I've built predictive models to detect fraud with SQL and Python's Scikit-learn library. I've developed a data pipeline, 
            where I connected to Teradata server using SQL and used Python for the transformation phase. 
            I'm proficient in Python, Java, Rust, and C.

            My interests and career goals are in software engineering and working with data. I love solving problems using data and technology.
