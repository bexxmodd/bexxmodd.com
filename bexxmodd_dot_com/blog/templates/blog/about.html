    <p>
        I'm a Software Engineer, where I solve business and production problems using C#, C++, and occasionally Python. I'm also a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania: School of Engineering and Applied Science.

    <p>
        I'm a huge OSS proponent and a have contributed to several projects. I also own and maintain two projects: Linux terminal program <a class="link" href="https://github.com/bexxmodd/vizex">vizex</a> and a <a class="link" href="">fuzzer</a> (random testing for C++ projects).
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>vizex</code> visually displays disk usage, directory data, directory tree within a terminal. It's like a combination of popular Linux commands du, df, ls but on steroids. Previously he worked as a Data Scientist.

        I come to this blog and I log about various topics I learned and problems I solved. Sometimes I even get Philosophical and try to see computers from metaphysical perspective.

        I love everything Sci-fi and consider myself a Lego enthusiast. My interests and career goals are aligned with Software Engineering. I'm passionate about better understanding computers and using this knowledge to solve real-world problems.
