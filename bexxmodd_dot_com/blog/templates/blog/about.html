            I'm a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania: School of Engineering and Applied Science. 
            Also, I'm Data Scientist, and an open-source developer.

            I've built predictive models to detect fraud with SQL and Python's Scikit-learn library. I've developed a data pipeline, 
            where I connected to Teradata server using SQL and used Python for the transformation phase. I'm proficient in Python, Java, Rust, and C. I've dockerized Python scripts to automate certain tasks.

            My interests and career goals are in software engineering. For now I'm considered myself as a generalit. I simply love solving problems using data and technology.
