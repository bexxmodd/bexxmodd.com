            I'm a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania: School of Engineering and Applied Science. 
            Also, I'm Data Scientist, and an open-source developer.

            I've built predictive models to detect fraud with SQL and Python's Scikit-learn library. I've developed a data pipeline, 
            where I connected to Teradata server using SQL and used Python for the transformation phase. I'm proficient in Python, Java, Rust, and C. I've Dockerized Python scripts to automate certain tasks.

            I love sci-fi stories and consider myself a Lego enthiusiast. My interests and career goals are in software engineering. I simply love solving problems using data and technology.
